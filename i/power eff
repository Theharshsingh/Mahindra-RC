# Power Efficiency
on the basis of the power factor robo are categorized as
1. Low Power Factor (LPF) - Power factor less than 0.8
2. Medium Power Factor (MPF) - Power factor between 0.8 and 0.95
3. High Power Factor (HPF) - Power factor greater than 0.95
Power factor is a measure of how effectively electrical power is being used by a device or system. It is defined as the ratio of real power (measured in watts) to apparent power (measured in volt-amperes). A higher power factor indicates more efficient use of electrical power, while a lower power factor indicates less efficient use. In the context of robotics and CNC machines, maintaining a high power factor can help reduce energy consumption and improve overall efficiency.

jog pendant 
A jog pendant, also known as a manual pulse generator (MPG), is a handheld device used to manually control the movement of a robot or CNC machine. It typically features a rotary dial or joystick that allows the operator to precisely control the speed and direction of the machine's movements. The jog pendant is commonly used for tasks such as positioning the machine for setup, performing manual operations, or making fine adjustments during programming and operation. It provides a convenient and intuitive interface for operators to interact with the machine and ensure accurate control over its movements.

features 
1. Speed control - The jog pendant allows operators to control the speed of the machine's movements, enabling them to make precise adjustments as needed.
2. Direction control - The jog pendant allows operators to control the direction of the machine's movements, allowing for easy positioning and adjustments.
3. Incremental movement - The jog pendant allows operators to make incremental movements, allowing for fine adjustments and precise positioning.

on the basis of power factor , welding robots are more power compatible .
welding robots
