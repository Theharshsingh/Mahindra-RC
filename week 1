            PRESENT INDIAN TECH INDUSTRY

# INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS   

a. ABB robots
* welding , material handling ,painting ,assembly
technology = multi axis articulated robot with precise motion control
industry use = automotive plants (tata motors)

b.FANUC , KUKA , YASKAWA
* heavy duty , CNC machines , automobile assembly
works= programmed path +sensors
cost=5-50 lakhs 

c. universal robots (UK)
UR18 "mega cobot" = 18 kg payload capacity
collaborative robots designed to work alognside humans without fences
programmmed = hand guiding /tablet ui
widely used in asia and europe


2. cobots 
collaborative robots  who are working alongside human safely
with built in sensors and light weighted structures
No safety caze is needed 
Quick to program and redeploy
cost= 5-25 lakh

3. autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)
move around warehouses and factories without fixed tracks and external guidance 
use LiDAR ,cameras and onboard AI

ex= addverb technologies (india) = grey orange = ai powered sorting 
Amazon warehouses use AMRs for picking and packing operations

4. humanoid robots
general purpose robots designed to resemble human form and perform a wide range of tasks
ex= asimo by honda = research and development
use sensors and advanced ai for navigation and interaction
potential applications = customer service , healthcare , entertainment

a. Boston dynamics = humanoid robot "atlas" = advanced mobility and dexterity
capable of running , jumping and performing complex tasks
DOF = 56 degrees of freedom for human like movement
potential applications = search and rescue , industrial inspection , logistics

b. AGIBOT = humanoid robot designed for customer service and hospitality
capable of greeting customers , providing information and assisting with tasks
WORK PROCESS = natural language processing + facial recognition
potential applications = hotels , airports , retail stores



# INDIAN SPECIFIC ROBOTS
ADVERB TECHNOLOGIES (INDIA) = grey orange = ai powered sorting and material handling robots for warehouses and factories
used by e-commerce companies and logistics providers to improve efficiency and reduce labor costs
COST = 10-30 lakhs depending on configuration and capabilities

MITRA ROBOTICS (INDIA) = humanoid robot designed for customer service and hospitality
VYOMMITRA = humanoid robot designed for customer service and hospitality
capable of greeting customers , providing information and assisting with tasks
