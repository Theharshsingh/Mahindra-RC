            PRESENT INDIAN TECH INDUSTRY

# INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS   

a. ABB robots
* welding , material handling ,painting ,assembly
technology = multi axis articulated robot with precise motion control
industry use = automotive plants (tata motors)

b.FANUC , KUKA , YASKAWA
* heavy duty , CNC machines , automobile assembly
works= programmed path +sensors
cost=5-50 lakhs 

c. universal robots (UK)
UR18 "mega cobot" = 18 kg payload capacity
collaborative robots designed to work alognside humans without fences
programmmed = hand guiding /tablet ui
widely used in asia and europe


2. cobots 
collaborative robots  who are working alongside human safely
with built in sensors and light weighted structures
No safety caze is needed 
Quick to program and redeploy
cost= 5-25 lakh

3. autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)
move around warehouses and factories without fixed tracks and external guidance 
use LiDAR ,cameras and onboard AI

ex= addverb technologies (india) = grey orange = ai powered sorting
