# cost factor 

1. industrial robots
avg cost 
- $50,000 - $100,000 for a basic robot
- $150,000 - $200,000 for more advanced models
- $500,000 or more for highly specialized robots

2. collaborative robots (cobots)
avg cost
- $20,000 - $50,000 for basic cobots
- $50,000 - $100,000 for more advanced cobots
- $100,000 or more for highly specialized cobots

3. autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)
avg cost
- $10,000 - $50,000 for basic AMRs
- $50,000 - $100,000 for more advanced AMRs
- $100,000 or more for highly specialized AMRs

4. robotic process automation (RPA) software
avg cost
- $5,000 - $20,000 per bot for basic RPA software
- $20,000 - $50,000 per bot for more advanced RPA software
- $50,000 or more per bot for highly specialized RPA software

5. maintenance and support costs
- annual maintenance costs can range from 10% to 20% of the initial cost of
the robot or software
- support costs can vary depending on the level of support required and the
 complexity of the robot or software, but can range from a few thousand dollars to tens
  of thousands of dollars per year.

1.compensation time- The time it takes for a robot to complete a task can vary greatly 
depending on the complexity of the task and the capabilities of the robot.

time = approx 2 years ( on the basis of productivity and efficiency of the robot)

2. return on investment (ROI) - The ROI of a robot can vary greatly depending on the cost of the robot, 
the productivity gains it provides, and the cost savings it generates.
ROI = (Productivity Gains + Cost Savings) / Cost of the Robot
3. payback period - The payback period is the time it takes for the cost savings
 generated by the robot to equal the initial cost of the robot.
Payback Period = Cost of the Robot / Annual Cost Savings
